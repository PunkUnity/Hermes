 * @file tools/hermes-session-broker.cpp
 * @brief Provision one Unix account per streaming client for an unprivileged Hermes.
 *
 * An isolated session is meant to be a machine of its own: its own desktop,
 * its own configuration, its own store accounts and saves, and no way to reach
 * the host's files or another client's. On Linux the boundary that actually
 * enforces that is the one the kernel already has - a separate uid. Everything
 * softer than that is a convention a determined client can walk around.
 *
 * Hermes runs as the person whose machine it streams, so it cannot create
 * accounts. This is the small root service that can, reachable over one unix
 * socket, speaking a line protocol:
 *
 *     ENSURE <client-uuid>  -> OK <user> <uid> <home>
 *     LOOKUP <client-uuid>  -> OK <user> <uid> <home>
 *     LIST                  -> OK <client-uuid>=<user>...
 *     PURGE <client-uuid>   -> OK
 *     START <client-uuid>   -> OK <unit>
 *       ARG <word>...         one line each, taken literally
 *       ENV <KEY>=<VALUE>...  one line each, taken literally
 *       SCOPE <suffix>        optional; a second unit beside the session's
 *       END
 *     STOP  <client-uuid>   -> OK
 *     STATUS <client-uuid>  -> OK <systemd ActiveState> <unit>
 *     SOCKET <client-uuid>  -> OK <wayland socket name>
 *
 * START is the only request that carries more than a line, because a session's
 * command and environment do not fit on one and splitting them on whitespace
 * would be a quoting bug waiting to happen. Every ARG and ENV line is used
 * whole, with one exception: an ENV whose name systemd cannot carry - a bash
 * exported function being the everyday case - is dropped with a warning to the
 * journal, because refusing the whole session over one shell artefact would
 * leave that machine unable to launch isolated sessions at all.
 *
 * ENSURE is idempotent: a client that comes back gets the account it had, which
 * is what makes its files still be there. Nothing is ever removed implicitly -
 * a client that unpairs keeps its account and its home, because a save game
 * outliving an accidental unpair is worth more than a tidy passwd file. PURGE
 * is the only destructive request and exists for the host to ask deliberately.
 *
 * Authorization is the peer's uid from SO_PEERCRED - filled in by the kernel,
 * so a client cannot claim to be someone else - checked against an allow file
 * only root can write.
 *
 * START does not run the session itself. It asks systemd for a transient unit
 * with `User=` set to the session account, which is the difference between a
 * session that merely runs as somebody else and one that is actually contained:
 * a unit started by PID 1 gets its own cgroup, its own sandboxing and its own
 * lifetime, where a process this broker forked would instead inherit this
 * unit's - a network namespace with no network, a `MemoryDenyWriteExecute` that
 * stops Wine from ever JITting, a hidden /home. The session outliving this
 * broker is a feature too: systemd reaps it, so a broker restart is not a
 * dropped desktop.
 *
 * `systemd-run` is asked rather than the bus method called directly, for the
 * same reason useradd is asked rather than /etc/passwd written: it already
 * owns the correct call, and reimplementing it is a class of bug worth not
 * owning. The session needs `/run/user/<uid>` and a user manager to have a
 * session bus at all, which is what lingering gets it; it does not need a
 * logind session, because its compositor takes the seat through seatd.
 *
 * The account name is derived here, never received. A client-supplied UUID is
 * hostile input: it is validated to hex and dashes, used only as a lookup key,
 * and never reaches a command line or a path. Names come from the first free
 * slot, so they are `hermes-s01` through the configured maximum by
 * construction and cannot be steered.
 *
 * What the account deliberately is not: it has no shell, no sudo, and is in
 * none of `wheel`, `video`, `input`, `render` or the host user's groups. Its
 * access to a GPU comes from the Hermes-KMS card's own access_uid, which is
 * per-card. It is in `hermes-session`, which the shipped polkit rule refuses
 * every action to - without that rule a session on a local seat would count as
 * "active and local" to polkit and be handed over a hundred passwordless
 * actions, including powering the host off and mounting its disks.
